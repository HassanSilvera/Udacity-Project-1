# Interpret a Data Visualization Project

This is the first project in Udacity's Business Analytics Nanodegree Program

## Requirements

The project required me to make three insights based on the visualizations provided by Udacity (Insights are observations or discoveries about the visualization such as a pattern or outlier in the data.). Along with the insights, I had to provide a screenshot as evidence for each insight. Both the insights and screenshots were organized on a Word document and converted to a PDF file for submission.
